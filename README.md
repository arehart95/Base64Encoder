# Base64Encoder
Simple Base64 Encoder and Decoder 

Followed along from the Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++  
The book had distinct separate implementations for encoding and decoding but  
I have placed them in a single main.c file with defined prototypes to build good habits.  

  
Overall very fascinating to learn about!
Encryption and security are topics that I am very interested in so I will continue to do my best  
and learn as much as I can.
